Built With Flutter

## Finopp

This app aims to connect startUps with Investors.
It was built to compete in the competition for African StartUps on App and Game Development 
in Egypt(http://techleaders.eg/aal/competition) in less than two weeks. Such is the power of flutter.
For now it is mostly UI, But Login and SignUp connects to FireBase
I hope I make through.. :pray: :pray: :pray:
